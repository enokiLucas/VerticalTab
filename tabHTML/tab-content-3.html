	<h4>Blood of Jesus Christ (military order)</h4>
	<p>Blood of Jesus Christ, or Blood of Christ, was a military order instituted at Mantua by Vincenzo I Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, approved on 25 May 1608 by Pope Paul V. The motto of the order was Domine probasti me, or that Nihil hoc triste recepto. Jean Hermant speaks of the order and observes that it took its name from some drops of the blood of Jesus, said to have been preserved in the cathedral church of Mantua. Their number was restricted to twenty besides the Grand Master; the office whereof was attached to himself and his successors.
